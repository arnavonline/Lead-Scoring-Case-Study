# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
**Problem Statement:**  
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, gathers leads through a form on their website. Sales teams then reach out via calls and emails, with a typical lead conversion rate of 30%. To improve efficiency, the company aims to identify "Hot Leads"—those with the highest potential—so the sales team can focus their efforts on these leads, increasing the conversion rate and optimizing their sales process.  

**Business Objective:**  
Lead X wants us to develop a model that assigns a lead score between 0-100, helping identify Hot Leads to boost conversion rates. The CEO aims for an 80% conversion rate and seeks a solution that can adapt to future challenges, such as peak times, resource optimization, and post-target strategies.
